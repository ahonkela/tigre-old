Description: The tigre package implements our methodology of Gaussian
        process differential equation models for analysis of gene
        expression time series from single input motif networks. The
        package can be used for inferring unobserved transcription
        factor (TF) protein concentrations from expression measurements
        of known target genes, or for ranking candidate targets of a
        TF.
